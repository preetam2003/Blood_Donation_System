                            To ensure that every patient in need of blood transfusion has access to safe and sufficient
                            blood, whenever and wherever they need it, by mobilizing a network of voluntary blood
                            donors.

                        <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-500">
                            We manage blood donation events, store collected blood safely, perform necessary testing,
                            and distribute it to hospitals. Our platform allows donors to register and find upcoming
                            camps, and lets patients search for blood availability in real-time.

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why It Matters</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-gray-500">
                            Blood cannot be manufactured – it can only come from generous donors. A single donation can
                            save up to three lives. By connecting donors with recipients, we are building a healthier,
                            more resilient community.
